/**
 * The schema-bundle staleness anchor (spec 14990 FR-006).
 *
 * `EXPECTED_SCHEMA_FINGERPRINT` pins the stable protocol-schema fingerprint
 * this SDK was written against. Two consumers:
 *
 *  - Build time: a test asserts this equals `schema/msp/stable/manifest.json`,
 *    so a schema advance that forgets the SDK reds the SDK lane instead of
 *    shipping a silently-stale facade. This is the same manifest-pin pattern
 *    the #210 transcripts use.
 *  - Runtime: the connection machine compares `InitializeResult.schema
 *    .fingerprint` against this pin. A mismatch is a WARNING, never an error
 *    (tdd SS1.4.1) — additive-optional evolution means an older SDK keeps
 *    working against a newer host.
