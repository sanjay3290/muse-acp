/**
 * `PendingCommand`: the client-side fold over pending commands.
 *
 * Normative source: tdd SS4.13 (owned by decision record D-032). This module
 * implements that subsection and does not re-derive it; every rule below
 * quotes or cites the clause it realizes. It is **client state only** — no
 * wire event, method, snapshot member, or durable record (INV-007), and it
 * never crosses the wire.
 *
 * The full fold is `S' = f(S, server events, pending client events)`: server
 * events remain the only source of durable truth, and a `PendingCommand`
 * entry is a rendering of the client's own intent.
 *
 * The entry itself is client-local by ruling, and its join keys (`commandId`,
 * `turnId`, `itemId`) are opaque strings by protocol rule (SS3.1.4, SS4.1).
 * The wire vocabulary it touches is fully generated: spec 206 Phase 11
 * (#22772) enrolled the `turn/start` ack and the `-32030` `commandRejected`
 * registry row, so INV-001's one recorded interim exception is discharged
 * here — nothing below restates a wire shape.
 *
 * Every comparison against a wire value goes through a constant ANNOTATED
 * with the generated vocabulary (`Extract<...>`), which is what makes a
 * misspelling a compile error. Comparing a bare literal against the open
 * `ErrorKind`/`TurnStartDisposition` unions typechecks either way — that
 * invisibility is precisely what the exception cost.
