 * this SDK owned the close. A host that closes stdout while still hung emits no
 * exit on the timescale that matters, so without this arm its session never
 * discharged: every pending command sat in the set as the durable-looking echo

 * gap: EOF IS the whole observation. The stderr tail and the SS2.11 row belong
 * to the process boundary, which has not reported yet — and when it does,
 * `Session.hostExited` latches the FIRST discharge, so a later exit replays the
 * EOF's report rather than overwriting it with a richer one. Whoever owns the
 * process still has `MuseServeChild.stderrTail` and its `exit` promise.
 *
 * ORDERLINESS IS NOT DECIDABLE HERE. `Connection` is duplex-generic and a
 * transport cannot tell a peer's hang-up from its own shutdown, so the layer
 * that KNOWS whether the close was its own is the one that builds this:
