/**
 * `Session` — the SS7.1 facade's composition of the transport-less core
 * (spec 14990 FR-018 / T030, FM-002 / T030b).
 *
 * It owns a `SessionFold` and a `PendingCommandSet`, routes folded view events
 * to per-turn handles, and discharges the ephemeral host-death obligation.
 * Like everything else in this SDK it holds no durable state (spec Lifecycle &
 * Composition): every fact it reports came from a server event or from the two
 * stores it composes.
 *
 * The SS4.8 splice-fill (FR-020, T032) is here too, in `gap-fill.ts`: this
 * layer owns it because the recipe needs client→server I/O (`view/page`) and
 * because the buffer it splices is the same routing path the iterators read.
 *
 * Everything else FR-018/FR-019 name IS here as of #23980: `sendUserTurn` over
 * the enrolled `turn/start` row, `onApproval`'s idempotent `approval/decide`
 * submission, and the SS4.13 retirement drivers that need client->server I/O.
 * The connection is an OPTIONAL seam: a fold-only `Session` — the transport-less
 * composition every earlier arm builds — stays valid and refuses the submit
 * verbs loudly rather than dropping a caller's input on the floor.
