/**
 * SS4.8 gap recovery by splice-fill (spec 14990 FR-020 / T032, tdd SS4.8).
 *
 * Split out of `session.ts` for the same reason `approval.ts` and
 * `turn-submit.ts` were: this is a delivery-plane concern with its own buffer,
 * page walk, and failure vocabulary, and `Session` was already the package's
 * largest module.
 *
 * THE RECIPE, verbatim from tdd SS4.8 and unchanged here: buffer live events
 * at cursors at or after `next` as they arrive; page forward from `after` with
 * `view/page` until the walk reaches `next`; discard the paged events the
 * buffer already holds; splice the buffer after the paged prefix. D-030's
 * second sanctioned path (drop state and re-anchor at the latest compaction
 * snapshot) is NOT built here — it is the #208 lane's spec work, and building
 * both would be a second concrete path for one current use.
 *
 * CURSORS STAY OPAQUE (tdd SS4.1). Nothing below orders two cursors: "at or
 * after `next`" is delivery ORDER, not a comparison — every live frame that
 * arrives after the gap marker is, by the server's own delivery contract, at
 * or after `next`. The walk stops on cursor EQUALITY with the target or on the
 * server's own end-of-view, and the overlap is discarded by set membership.
