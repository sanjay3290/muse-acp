/**
 * `MuseClient` — the SS7.1 facade's session-opening half (FR-018, T030).
 *
 * It turns the two v1 session verbs into correctly-shaped `session/start` /
 * `session/resume` params and hands back a WIRED `Session`. It frames nothing
 * and mints nothing: `Connection.command()` stamps the `commandId` from the
 * single injected mint, so INV-013's single-minter property is preserved by
 * DELEGATION rather than re-implemented here.
 *
 * IT OWNS TWO FACTS NO OTHER LAYER HOLDS, and that is why obligations (b) and
 * (c) of T030 live here rather than on `Session`:
 *
 *  - WHETHER A CLOSE WAS OURS. `Connection` is duplex-generic; a transport
 *    cannot tell a peer's hang-up from its own shutdown. SS2.13.3b counts
 *    "process exit **or transport EOF**" as a death, so somebody has to know
 *    the difference, and only the layer that owns `close()` does.
 *  - WHAT AN EARLIER DEATH DISCARDED. `DiscardedSessions` is client-scoped, so
 *    a `commandId` refusal and a withheld reattach survive the `Session` object
 *    that died — which is exactly what "do not replay the SESSION's commandIds"
 *    requires of a client that then opens a new session.
 *
 * OPTIONAL MEANS OMITTED, NEVER `null` (tdd SS1.2). Every member this module
 * can leave unset is optional-non-nullable in the generated params, so an
 * unset member is dropped from the frame rather than nulled. The guards below
 * are LOOSE (`!= null`) on purpose: the types only bind strict TypeScript
 * consumers, and a plain-JS caller reaching the built `dist` can pass an
 * explicit `null` that a `!== undefined` guard would forward verbatim. `false
 * != null` is true, so `excludeItems: false` still serializes.
 *
 * The params and the caller options are both COMPOSED from the generated
 * types rather than restated (INV-001: narrow and compose, never restate).
 * Composition alone does NOT stop drift, though: the guard chains below are
 * hand-listed, so a regenerated member would be settable by a caller and then
 * silently dropped on the way to the wire. The `AssertNever` pins next to each
 * chain close that gap — add a member upstream and the BUILD fails here until
 * it is forwarded (or explicitly allow-listed as unforwardable).
