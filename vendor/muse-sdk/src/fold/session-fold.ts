/**
 * `SessionFold` — the SS4 client fold, bound to the generated wire types
 * (spec 14990 FR-007, tasks.md T019).
 *
 * `ItemStore` and `SessionStateStore` are generic because they were written
 * before the session-view plane entered the generated declarations. This
 * module is where the generic parameters are BOUND: items are `@muse-code/msp`'s
 * `Item`, state-family values are the generated `session/*` params objects,
 * and every event this fold accepts is typed as the params object the wire
 * actually carries. Nothing here restates a wire shape (INV-001).
 *
 * Beyond the two-store composition, the fold owns the parts of the view that
 * are neither an item nor a state family:
 *
 *  - the TURN LIFECYCLE — `turn/started`, `turn/completed`, `turn/retracted`,
 *    `turn/unqueued`, and the non-terminal `turn/retryScheduled`;
 *  - the APPROVAL and USER-INPUT view events as fold INPUTS — the pending
 *    sets and their first durable terminal. The decision flow (choosing and
 *    sending a resolution) is the facade's, not the fold's;
 *  - the DELIVERY marker `view/gap` — it seeds no store, it moves the fold's
 *    CURRENCY (`pendingGap`/`current`, FM-003). The recovery that fills the
 *    hole needs client→server I/O and is therefore the facade's (T032).
 *
 * INV-006 governs all of it: the fold never invents a terminal. A retract and
 * a reclaim are not `TurnTerminal` values and are never rendered as one, an
 * unrecognized `TurnTerminal` is kept verbatim, and a second resolution never
 * displaces the first durable one.
